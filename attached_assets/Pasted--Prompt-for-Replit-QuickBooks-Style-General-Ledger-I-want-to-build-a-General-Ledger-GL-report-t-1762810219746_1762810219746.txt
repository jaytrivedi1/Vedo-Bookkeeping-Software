✅ Prompt for Replit: QuickBooks-Style General Ledger

I want to build a General Ledger (GL) report that looks and works like the one in QuickBooks Online.

🎯 Purpose

Show every transaction for each account (like a bank, receivable, payable, expense, etc.) in date order with running balances — just like QuickBooks.

📘 Layout / Structure

For each account (example: “RBC Bank”, “Stripe Clearing”, “Accounts Receivable (A/R)”), the ledger should appear as:

Account Header (expandable)

Shows the account name (and currency if multicurrency is on)

Can be expanded or collapsed

At the end of each account, show “Total for [Account Name]”

Inside each account, show these columns:

Date

Transaction Type (Invoice, Payment, Expense, Deposit, etc.)

# (Transaction Number)

Name (Customer, Vendor, or Payee)

Memo/Description

Split (the other account involved)

Amount (Debit or Credit depending on account type)

Running Balance

(If multicurrency is enabled, also show “Foreign Amount” and “Exchange Rate.”)

🧮 Behavior

Show Beginning Balance at the top of each account (based on opening or prior balance).

List all transactions by date.

Show Total for each account at the end.

Show Grand Total at the bottom for all accounts.

Debit and Credit columns must balance across the full report.

Use parentheses ( ) for negative balances.

⚙️ Filters / Options (top of report)

Date range (From / To)

Account filter (single account or All)

Transaction Type filter (optional)

Sort by Date or Transaction #

Export to PDF, Excel, or CSV

Print-friendly layout

Expand / Collapse all accounts

🧩 Technical Logic

Fetch all journal entries and transaction lines within the date range.

Group lines by Account ID.

For each group:

Sort by Transaction Date → Transaction Number → Line ID

Calculate Running Balance = previous balance + (debit − credit)

Add Beginning Balance (sum of prior transactions before the report start date).

Combine all accounts into one report.

Format with proper alignment (numbers right-aligned, 2-decimal precision).

If multicurrency is active:

Show foreign amounts + rate

Totals and balance always in Home Currency
